'''Vlerq''' [http://www.vlerq.org/] is a research project dealing with data
structures and persistence.

Ignoring conventional wisdom, it uses an ''inverted'' column-oriented way to
represent and manipulate data in software. The implications are far-reaching
and exciting.

Vlerq (pronounced as "flair-k") is an acronym which describes the idea:

* Take '''V'''ectors
* Add a '''L'''anguage
* Make it '''E'''mbeddable
* Use the '''R'''elational model
* Include a '''Q'''uery mechanism

Time will tell how well this approach works. Vlerq will remain experimental for
some time, but its goal is to deliver practical, robust, portable, efficient,
deployable software.

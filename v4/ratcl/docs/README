All *.txt files here use wikit markup conventions with a few extensions:
- headers: lines surrounded by ***, **, or * become h1/h2/h3 titles
- lists: "*" or "N." in col 1 or col 4, for level 1/2 lists, respectively
- quotes: add ">" in front of lines to make them stand out as blockquoted text
- page references: refer to file "blah.txt" in this dir as [blah] in wiki text
- image: place in the images/ directory and refer to it as [img:example.png]
- all wikifiable pages need a line in the "pagelist" file with their title
There are some quirks, this is not based on the wikit code.

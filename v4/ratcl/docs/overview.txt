Ratcl aims to become the successor of Mk4tcl and OOMK, with Vlerq replacing the Metakit C++ library, eventually.  The database file format remains compatible:

Ratcl includes a range of relational algebra and set operators to manipulate
structured datasets. These operators use a ''functional'' and ''non-procedural''
programming style, and reduce the need to write loops to find, collect, and
re-arrange data.

All data can be treated as being in memory and used with regular Tcl commands,
even though that data can reside in one or more platform-independent datafiles.

This is a Python binding to "Thrive", a threaded interpreter vector engine.

This package is released as open source under the same license as Python,
see http://www.python.org/psf/license/

The files in this package are automatically generated by the Vlerq project
(using "make thrive-py"), see http://www.vlerq.org

To compile, starting in vlerq top level dir:
  sh configure
  cd build
  make thrive-py
  cd thrive-py
  python setup.py build
  ln -s build/lib*/thrive.so .
(if you only got thrive-py, skip the first three steps above)

To try it out:
  python vtry.py

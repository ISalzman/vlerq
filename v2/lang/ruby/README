This is a Ruby binding to "Thrive", a threaded interpreter vector engine.

This package is released as open source under the same license as Ruby,
see http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/LICENSE.txt

The files in this package are automatically generated by the Vlerq project
(using "make thrive-rb"), see http://www.vlerq.org

To compile, starting in vlerq top level dir:
  sh configure
  cd build
  make thrive-rb
  cd thrive-rb
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
(if you only got thrive-rb, skip the first three steps above)

To try it out:
  ruby vtry.rb

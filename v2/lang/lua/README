This is a Lua 5.1 binding to "Thrive", a threaded interpreter vector engine.

This package is released as open source under the same license as Lua,
see http://www.lua.org/copyright.html

The files in this package are automatically generated by the Vlerq project
(using "make thrive-lua"), see http://www.vlerq.org

To compile, starting in vlerq top level dir:
  sh configure
  cd build
  make thrive-lua
  cd thrive-lua
  make
(if you only got thrive-lua, skip the first three steps above)

To try it out:
  lua vtry.lua
